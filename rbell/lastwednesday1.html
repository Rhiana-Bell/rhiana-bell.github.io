<h1>What I did last Wednesday!</h1>
<p>This was actually my Thursday last week, but lets pretend it was a Wednesday so my life seems less boring...</p>
<h3>What I did last Wednesday (shhh..)</h3>
<p>Last Wednesday I was back in my home town in South Carolina. There are a few hiking spots in South Carolina that I enjoy. So I decided to go to one of my favorites, 
    It's called 40 Acre Rock. It is this huge sloping expanse of rock, surrounded by trees and the occasional pools of stagnant water. 
    The stagnant water might be off putting to some people (mosquitoes..), but it was cold and I was spared. Without any nuisances I was able to enjoy the look of the pools.</p>

<p>There are other spots and quirks at 40 Acre Rock that I enjoy, some coming with local <a href=lastwednesday2.html> campfire stories.</a></p>
